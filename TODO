Things for 2.5:
[09:27] <hyc> we also need to audit all of these schema defs
[09:27] <hyc> we're supposed to have official, non-experimental OIDs for released schema
[09:28] <hyc> accesslog is still using 666, experimental arc
[09:29] <hyc> I think this means we should polish up the logschema draft, Informational status, and publish it again as final

[13:57] <hyc> there's a nagging problem though, pcache's entry_release function needs to distinguish between its backend actually freeing the entry, or being a no-op
[13:57] <hyc> so it can decide whether to return success or continue
[13:58] <hyc> the patch to translucent sidesteps the question, by avoiding other overlays
[13:58] <hyc> but we need to revisit this in 2.5

  ITS#7920 fix for slapacl This needs to be streamlined in 2.5, current tool API is a mess.

ITS#7926 - [18:19] <hyc> this is going to be a WONTFIX for 2.4, I think
[18:20] <hyc> reiniting the listeners array is probably too much of a pain. it will screw with all currently open connections
